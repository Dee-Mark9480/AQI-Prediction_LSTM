# Ivy-Homes-API-Solution

Overview
A sophisticated Python-based solution for comprehensively extracting names from an undocumented autocomplete API. The project demonstrates advanced API exploration, intelligent extraction strategies, and robust error handling.

Key Features:
🔍 Dynamic API exploration
🚦 Adaptive rate limit handling
🧵 Multithreaded extraction
📊 Comprehensive logging and checkpointing
🛡️ Resilient error management

Technical Highlights:
Uses breadth-first search algorithm for efficient name discovery
Implements exponential backoff for rate-limited requests
Supports resumable extraction with checkpoint mechanism
Handles various API constraints and unpredictabilities

Extraction Strategy:
Start with single-character prefixes
Dynamically expand promising prefixes
Use multiple worker threads for concurrent extraction
Automatically save progress and handle interruptions

Performance Metrics:
Total Unique Names: [Will be populated after extraction]
Total API Requests: [Will be populated after extraction]
Extraction Duration: [Will be populated after extraction]

Prerequisites:
Python 3.8+
requests library
